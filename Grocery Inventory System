Grocery Inventory System

A grocery store wants to implement a system to keep track of their inventory and sales. Each product in the store is identified by a unique name and has a price and stock quantity.

The store manager wants a Python program that does the following:

Input Details: Accept a list of product details where each product's information includes its name, price, and stock (all entered in a single line).
Query Sales: Accept customer sales queries in the form of a dictionary, where the keys are product names, and the values are quantities to be purchased.
Update Inventory: Update the stock after processing the sales queries. If the requested quantity is not available, the sale for that product should not proceed.
Output Results: Print the total cost for the customer and the updated inventory in dictionary form.
Input Details
First Input: A list of products, where each product detail is a space-separated string in the format:

name price stock
Second Input: A dictionary where:
Keys are product names.
Values are quantities the customer wants to purchase.
Output Details
Total cost of the sale.
Updated inventory in dictionary format.
Example Input and Output

Input:
apple 10 50 banana 5 100 cherry 20 30
{'apple': 5, 'banana': 10, 'cherry': 40}

Output:
Total Cost: 100
Updated Inventory: {'apple': 45, 'banana': 90, 'cherry': 30}

Explanation:
Initial inventory:
apple: Price = 10, Stock = 50
banana: Price = 5, Stock = 100
cherry: Price = 20, Stock = 30

Customer requests:
5 apples: Available, cost = 5 * 10 = 50.
10 bananas: Available, cost = 10 * 5 = 50.
40 cherries: Not enough stock (only 30 available), so sale doesn't proceed.
Total cost = 50 + 50 = 100
Updated inventory:
apple: 50 - 5 = 45
banana: 100 - 10 = 90
cherry: 30 (unchanged).15:45 27-01-2025
